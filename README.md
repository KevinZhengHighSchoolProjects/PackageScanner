# PackageScanner
The goal is to create a computer vision system using python that can detect student names on packages, and then send an email via the school email system to notify them to go to the mailroom to pick up their package. The system uses openCV and PyTesseract for text detection, google's API to get the spreadsheet of student names, and finally SMTP to send the email. 

Due to privacy concerns, emails, credidentials, and so on have been wiped or not uploaded to this github repo. Please email me at jebidiahkerman828@gmail.com if you want an uncensored repo and demonstration. Thank you for your consideration.
